## 📊 Memory Configuration Guide

| GPU Memory | Batch Size | Grad Accum | Training Samples | Expected Time |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **8GB**    | 2          | 4          | 15,000           | ~1.5-2 hours  |
| **12GB**   | 4          | 2          | 35,000           | ~2-3 hours    |
| **16GB**   | 6          | 2          | 75,000           | ~3-4 hours    |
| **24GB+**  | 12         | 1          | 150,000          | ~4-6 hours    |

_Note: MLP version is more memory-efficient and trains faster than transformer approach_

## 🔧 Configuration Options

Edit `config.py` to adjust:

```python
# For smaller GPU (8GB)
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    "subset_size": 15000,
    "batch_size": 2,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 4,
}

# For larger GPU (24GB+)
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    "subset_size": 150000,
    "batch_size": 12,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 1,
}

# MLP-specific settings
MLP_CONFIG = {
    "hidden_size": 4096,        # Llama hidden size
    "intermediate_size": 16384,  # 4x expansion
    "activation": "relu",       # Simple activation
}
```

## 🎯 Training Process

### What Happens:

1. **Model Setup**: Loads Llama-2-7B and creates modified architecture
2. **Layer Pruning**: Removes layers 20-29 (10 layers total)
3. **MLP Training**: Trains simple 2-layer MLP to replace removed layers
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Lower memory usage than transformer approach

### MLP Architecture:

```
Input (4096) → Linear (16384) → ReLU → Linear (4096) → Output
```

### Expected Output:

```
Loading model: meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
Creating modified model with MLP lightweight layer...
MLP lightweight layer will be trained from scratch (no weight initialization needed)
Trainable: replace_layer.fc1.weight

```

## 📈 Training Progress

### Monitor These Metrics:

- **Training Loss**: Should decrease more quickly than transformer
- **Validation Loss**: Target metric for model quality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### GPU Out of Memory (Less common with MLP)

```bash
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```

**Solution**: Reduce `batch_size` in `config.py` (start with 1 if needed)

#### MLP Training Loss Plateau

**Solution**:

- Increase learning rate (`learning_rate: 5e-4`)
- Increase training samples
- Try different activation function

#### Model Performance Lower Than Expected

**Solution**:

- Train for more epochs
- Use larger training dataset
- Consider switching to transformer approach for better quality

## 🚀 Performance Expectations

### Compression Results:

- **Original**: Llama-2-7B (32 layers)
- **Compressed**: 22 layers + 1 MLP layer
- **Size Reduction**: ~25% smaller (similar to transformer approach)
- **Quality**: ~85-90% of original performance (vs ~90-95% for transformer)

### Training Characteristics:

- **Speed**: 30-50% faster than transformer approach
- **Memory**: 20-30% less GPU memory usage
- **Stability**: More stable training, less hyperparameter tuning needed

## 🎯 When to Use MLP vs Transformer

### **Choose MLP if:**

- ✅ Limited GPU memory (8-12GB)
- ✅ Want faster training
- ✅ Prefer training stability
- ✅ Acceptable with slightly lower quality

### **Choose Transformer if:**

- ✅ Have sufficient GPU memory (16GB+)
- ✅ Want maximum quality
- ✅ Can afford longer training time
- ✅ Willing to tune hyperparameters

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Multi-GPU Training:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file 4gpu.yaml train_modified.py
```

### Custom MLP Architecture:

Modify `MLP_CONFIG` in `config.py`:

```python
MLP_CONFIG = {
    "hidden_size": 4096,
    "intermediate_size": 8192,  # Smaller for faster training
    "activation": "gelu",       # Different activation
}
```

### Comparison Script:

```bash
python config.py  # Shows MLP vs Transformer comparison
```
